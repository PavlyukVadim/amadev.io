### What is lexical scope

The scope is the accessibility of some objects in some part of your programm.
Lexical scope is a scope that defined during lexing time (surprisingly).


### Functions as scope

In javascript each functions defined a separate scope, for example:

```js
function bar(a) {
  var b = 2
  console.log(a, b) // 1, 2
}

bar(1)
```

When we call log method to output variable, inner engine mechanism triger look-up process for a and b, and as far as they are enclosed by bar function they'll be found in that inner scope.

But, what if variable is absent in function defenition:


```js
function foo(a) {
  var b = 2

  function bar(a) {
    console.log(a, b) // 1, 2
  }

  bar(a)
}

foo(1)
```

In that case look-up process will use a inner (hidden) function property [[Scope]], that refers to parent scope until it goes to the global scope.

Note: look-up process works until it find the first match:

```js
var a = 3
var b = 4

function foo(a) {
  var b = 2

  function bar(a) {
    console.log(a, b) // 1, 2
  }

  bar(a)
}

foo(1)
```

#### IIFE

If you want just to enclose data into some scope and you actually don't need a extra function that have to called after it defenition, you can use Immediately Invoked Function Expression:

```js
var a = 3;
(function () {
  var a = 5
  console.log(a) // 5
})()
console.log(a) // 3
```

### Blocks As Scopes

In most programming languages scope are defining by blocks of code, javascript is different:

```js
var flag = true
if (flag) {
  var a = 4
  console.log(a) // 4
}
console.log(a) // 4
```

The reason is in a process that called hoisting, we're going to examinate it in the next article.

But with ES6 let/const you can ahcive exactly that behaviour:

```js
let a = 5
{
  const a = 3
  console.log(a) // 3
}
console.log(a) // 5
```

When look-up failers it throw an relative error:

```js
var flag = true
if (flag) {
  let a = 4
  console.log(a) // 4
}
console.log(a) // Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
```

#### Loops

Let variables have a very useful property to rebinding to each iteration of the loop, so the plain loop:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	console.log(i)
}
```

can be assumed like:

```js
{
	let j
	for (j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
		let i = j // re-bound
		console.log(i)
	}
}
```

### try/catch as scope

ES3 support block-scope for the catch parameter:

```js
try {
  const a = 5
	a++
}
catch (err) {
  var foo = true
	console.log(err) // works
}

console.log(foo) // true
console.log(err) // Uncaught ReferenceError
```


### How to change a lexical scope in runtime

Firstly I have to notice, that is't a really bad idea, that disable engine inner optimization of your program.

There're a few ways to change a lexical scope in runtime:
* eval
  * takes a string of code and perform it
  * modify existing lexical scope
  * with strict-mode use inner lexical scope
* new Function(..)
  * create a function using string as function body
* with
  * creates a new lexical scope
  * deprecated!
