# JS Core:

## A:

#### ```Array```

Basic composing data type. More on in [complete guide to Arrays](/posts/arrays-in-javascript-complete-guide).

#### ```Abstract Equality```
Comparison operator (```x == y```, where x and y are values, produces ```true``` or ```false```).

#### ```AJAX```

#### ```Arrow Functions```

## B:

## C:

#### ```Call stack```
A stack data structure that keeps information about active function call.

## D:

#### ```Data type```
Abstraction that has a bounded set of available values and operations that can be performed on these values.

#### ```Dynamic typing```

Means that ariable can represents any value of any type. Read also: [Duck typing](#duck-typing), [Weak typing](#weak-typing).

#### ```Duck typing```
General term for "type checks" that make assumptions about a value's "type"
based on its shape (what properties are present).
"If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck". Read also: [Dynamic typing](#dynamic-typing), [Weak typing](#weak-typing).


## E:

#### ```Event loop```
The mechanism that performs moving functions from the ```event queue``` to ```call stack``` when it becomes empty. Read more about [event loop](/posts/event-loop-in-javascript).

## F:

#### ```First-class Function```

Functions are treated as values â€“ you can assign a function into a variable, pass it around etc. Read also: [Higher-order Function](#higher-order-function).

## G:

#### ```Generator```

Function that can be paused in mid-completion with saving inner state ([example](/posts/generators-in-javascript#generator)). 


## H:

#### ```Higher-order Function```

A function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function. Read also: [First-class Function](#first-class-function).

#### ```Hoisting```
Moving all declarations to their respective scopes.


## I:

#### ```Introspection```

The ability of a program to examine the type or properties of an object at runtime. Read more in the [Complete Guide to Objects](/posts/objects-in-javascript-complete-guide#introspection-in-js).

#### ```Iterable```

An object that contains an iterator that can iterate over its values ([example](/posts/iterators-in-javascript#iterable)).

#### ```Iterator```

An object that has the ```next(..)``` method on its interface ([example](/posts/iterators-in-javascript#iterator)).

## J:

#### ```JSON```

#### ```JSON-safe```
JSON-safe values consist of values that can be represented as JSON.
Not JSON-safe: ```undefined```s, ```function```s, ```symbol```s, ```object```s with circular references, ```Date```s, ```Infinity```, ```RegExp```s, ```Map```s, ```Set```s, ```Blob```s, ```FileList```s, sparse ```Array```s, ```Typed Array```s or other complex types.

## K:


## L:

#### ```Lexical scope```
[Scope](#scope) that defined during the lexing time.

#### ```Let```

#### ```Localstorage```

## M:

#### ```Map```

## N:

#### ```Number```

Numeric data type, that represents both integer and fractional numbers. Read more in the [Complete Guide to Numbers](/posts/numbers-in-javascript-complete-guide).

## O:

#### ```Object```

Basic data type. More on in [complete guide to Objects](/posts/objects-in-javascript-complete-guide).



## P:

#### ```Promise```

#### ```Proxy```

ES6 feature that allows boxing software component with an interception of component handlers, like getting/setting/deleting/enumeration object properties, applying arguments to functions, etc.


## Q:


## R:

#### ```Reflect```

#### ```Reflection```

The ability for a program to manipulate the values, meta-data, properties and/or functions of an object at runtime.

#### ```Regular Expressions```


## S:

#### ```Scope```
The accessibility of objects (variables/functions) in some part of your program.

#### ```Set```

#### ```Symbol```

New data type offered by ES6, a unique identifier for special object properties.

#### ```Stack frame```
Block of the [stack](#call-stack) corresponds to some function call that keeps relative information about this call (local variables, parameters, a location where to be returned).

## T:

#### ```TCO```
*Tail Call Optimization*. Read more about [TCO in JavaScript](/posts/tail-call-optimization-in-javascript).


## U:

## V:

## W:

#### ```Weak typing```
Means that compiler can use ```implicit cast```. [Dynamic typing](#dynamic-typing), [Duck typing](#duck-typing).

#### ```WeakMap```

#### ```WeakSet```

## X:
## Y:
## Z:
