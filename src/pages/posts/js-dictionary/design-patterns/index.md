Place with explanations for each buzzword in the JS world.ðŸ˜€

# Design Patterns:

#### ```Adapter```

A ```pattern``` for attainment compatibility that allows converting a class, function, or other components into the component with the interface we need.

#### ```Command```

A ```pattern``` that defines action and parameters as an object (like assuming a bank account transaction as an array of such objects, that objects often could be revoking).

#### ```Factory```

A ```pattern``` for producing function, object, other data structures.

#### ```Facade```

A ```pattern``` for hiding the complexity, it offers a common interface for controlling instances of different classes.


#### ```Singleton```

A ```pattern``` that provides existing of a single instance of a class.

#### ```Strategy```

A ```pattern``` that selects one of interchangeable classes that contain a behavior that is similar in functionality and implements a common interface (example for ```FP``` is ```Array.prototype.sort``` method).
