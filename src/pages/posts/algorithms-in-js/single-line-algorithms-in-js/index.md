## Overview

Algorithms is one of basic parts of the every programmer's skills scope. I'm sure that you heard a lot of them, and how they a important for effecien problem solving. With a multiparagigm JavaScript we have a nice opportunity in mixing different styles and patterns for getting much more elegant code. It some time we can each achive our goal in singe-line of code, and i'm not about minimazed (uglified) code, i'm about a realy singe-line of effective vanila code (for standartizint let's cound it in 80 or less characters lenght). As far as it needs a deep knowleagle even for a easy tast, i'm sure this will be so useful for everyone. Let's fun and learn.

## Structure

There are a lot's of task's, we'll order them by complexity from the esiest on the list's top to the most difficult at the bottom.


## Strings

String is one of basic structure for any programming language, and javascript isn't an exception. We use them every day in our typical task, from handle input data from users at client to parsing files using node.js. Let's start here:
