## Overview

Algorithms questions are one of the parts of the common javascript interviews. Depend on the company you'll have different tasks, for solving witch often needs to using some algorithms, or using algorithms might give a more elegant and optimized solution. Some companies have even a separate algorithmic interview, that focused only on that specific domain. Why is this so important? The answer is simple. Firstly it demonstrates your common computer science knowledge. The second reason, it's checking your approach to solving general problems, and how much find the optimal way is important for you. Despite, you use algorithms often in your daily task or you don't even remember last time when they were helpful for you, additional knowledge can save your time in future problems. So, at least it's useful to be familiar with them. Let's start here:

## Structure

There are lots of algorithms, they will be ordered by complexity (from the easiest ones at the beginning of a topic to the difficult ones at the end). Topics combine by algorithms, that operated with the same data structure. 

We'll start from the ```string```:
