Hi everyone and welcome to the first tutorial on my blog! Iâ€™m criticaster, and this info should be enough for you at this time. You might saw me at YouTube, so donâ€™t wonder, yeap, itâ€™s me. Letâ€™s better write some code.ðŸ˜€

## Intro & preconditions

As you can notice we're going to create a "Snake" game. We'll use no frameworks and game engines for this. Just using plain ```javascript``` we'll create game step by step. The result shoud be like [this](/demos/snake-game-in-js) (DEMO).

## Place where everything begins

Letâ€™s create the first file for our tiny project - ```index.html```. After that, we create a ```javascript``` file and connect it with ```index.html```

```html:title=index.html
<body>
  <script src="src/index.js"></script>
</body>
```

For rendering our game on the screen weâ€™ll use ```canvas```. Also, letâ€™s add an element for a score (snake length) and some styles:

```html:title=index.html
<body>
  <script src="src/index.js"></script>
  <style media="screen">
    #map {
      display: block;
      margin: 0 auto;
      border: 1px dashed red;
    }

    .wrapper {
      position: relative;
      width: 500px;
      height: 500px;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }

    #score {
      position: absolute;
      right: 0;
      top: 0;
      margin: 10px;
      font: 35px Comic Sans MS;
    }
  </style>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <p id="score">length: 0</p>
    <canvas id="map" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
  </div>
</body>
```

All that we have now it's:

## Time for javascript

Now, itâ€™s time for our ```index.js```  from the previous step. We should catch the moment of rendering ```DOM``` elements. Do you know how to do that? One of the ways - ```window.onload``` method. Letâ€™s use it for getting access to the ```DOM``` elements and starting our game loop.

```js:title=src/index.js
window.onload = () => {
  const canvas = document.getElementById('map')
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')
  
  startGame()
}
```

After that, we can go to the implementation of the ```startGame``` function. We need some abstraction to collect all info about the game state. As itâ€™s ```javascript``` - what can be better than an object?).

```js:title=src/index.js
const game = {}
startGame(game)
```

But what info should we keep there? We have at least 2 types of game objects: snake and foods. So we have to implement them and place into object ```game```.

Letâ€™s start from ```class``` Snake Snake and define methods for it. At the start, it'll look like this:

```js:title=src/index.js
class Snake {
  constructor() {}
  // drawing snake on the canvas
  draw() {}
  // snake's moving
  running() {}

  // snake's control using keyboard
  directionControl() {}

  // control snake's growing
  snakeLengthControl() {}

  // checking intersections with map boards
  validationCoordinates() {}

  // checking inner collision of snake's head with body
  findSnakeÐ¡ollision() {}
}
```

Now we can describe them more details.
At first, we should decide what data we need to our snake, weâ€™ll pass that data into a ```constructor```. For determination snake's head position we can use just ```x```, ```y```, and ```coordinates``` array for storing the previous position. Also, we need to know the snake ```lenght```, direction (```angle```), ```color```, canvas context that connected to snake (```ctx```).

After that we get constructor:

```js:title=src/index.js
constructor(x, y, angle, length, ctx) {
  this.x = x
  this.y = y
  this.angle = angle
  this.length = length
  this.ctx = ctx
  this.coordinates = []
}
```

But also we have some common characteristics, that we can separate from inner properties as ```static``` properties:

```js:title=src/index.js
Snake.COLOR = '#ff5050'
Snake.INITIAL_LENGTH = 100
Snake.HEAD_RADIUS = 5
Snake.SPEED = 2 // points per iteration
Snake.ROTATION_SPEED = 5 // degrees per iteration
```

Well, now letâ€™s consider drawing method. We can implement that using ```canvas``` drawing methods. We should just draw circles of some radius and some color which we keep in our object.

So, itâ€™ll look like that:

```js:title=src/index.js
draw() {
  this.ctx.beginPath()
  this.ctx.fillStyle = Snake.COLOR
  this.ctx.arc(this.x, this.y, Snake.HEAD_RADIUS, 0, 2 * Math.PI)
  this.ctx.fill()
  this.ctx.closePath()
}
```

But all that we have for now - it's an object which can paint static point on the canvas. As you can guess weâ€™re going to implement the ```running``` method. The logic of running is simple. On each iteration, we should change the snake's head position using speed:

```js:title=src/index.js
running() {
  this.x += Snake.SPEED
  this.y += Snake.SPEED
}
```

Ok, to test our ```running``` we should return to ```startGame``` function and implement the game loop. We stopped on the ```game``` object, that collects all data about our game objects and parameters. Now we can pass first of them into the ```game``` - the instance of ```Snake``` class:

```js:title=src/index.js
window.onload = () => {
  const canvas = document.getElementById('map')
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')
  
  const snake = new Snake(100, 100, 0, Snake.INITIAL_LENGTH, ctx)  // highlight-line
  const game = {             // highlight-line
    snake,                   // highlight-line
  }                          // highlight-line
  startGame(game)            // highlight-line
}
```

So, now we have access to snake inside ```startGame```. To implement game loop we have to call ```running``` with some frequency. There are a few ways to do that, but weâ€™ll choose the easier - ```setInterval```. After that our function will be like that:

```js:title=src/index.js
const startGame = (game) => {
  const { snake } = game
  
  game.snakeInterval = setInterval(snake.running, 30)
}
```

But, if you launch this code, youâ€™ll get the error (```Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'angle' of undefined
at running```) inside ```running``` method, because setInterval loses context and ```running``` method doesnâ€™t know anything about the snake, to solve that we should ```bind``` context to the method:


```js:title=src/index.js
const startGame = (game) => {
  const { snake } = game
  
  game.snakeInterval = setInterval(snake.running.bind(snake), 30) // highlight-line
}
```

Is your ```canvas``` still empty? Weâ€™re changing position on each iteration of ```setInterval```, but we don't call ```draw``` method to repaint our canvas, so some changes:

```js:title=src/index.js
running() {
  this.x += Snake.SPEED
  this.y += Snake.SPEED

  this.draw() // highlight-line
}
```

And now our canvas comes alive:

![](assets/snake-in-js-example-1.gif)

Ok, move forward and consider our control function. Our snake will turn due to keys' s events. Press on left arrow will turn snake to left and on right to turn it right. So we need to connect ```directionControl```  method with an event listener. There a no better place for that then ```startGame``` function. We can use ```eventListener``` on whole ```document``` object:

```js:title=src/index.js
const startGame = (game) => {
  const { snake } = game
  
  game.snakeInterval = setInterval(snake.running, 30)
 
  addEventListener('keydown', snake.directionControl) // highlight-line
}
```

Perfection, now ```directionControl``` will be called each time when you press on some key. And our method will get all the information about that event via the parameter. So, itâ€™s time to handle that. We have a simple condition, if ```keyCode``` of the pressed key is ```37``` weâ€™ll call a ```turnLeft``` method, that decrease snake ```angle```, and opposite way if keyCode is ```39```:


```js:title=src/index.js
directionControl(e) {
  switch(e.keyCode) {
    case 37: {
      this.turnLeft()
      break
    }
    case 39: {
      this.turnRight()
      break
    }
  }
}

turnLeft() {
  this.angle -= Snake.ROTATION_SPEED
}

turnRight() {
  this.angle += Snake.ROTATION_SPEED
}
```

However, we donâ€™t use ```angle``` value. Where should we place it? Yep, into ```running```. At this moment our ```running``` method just increases the value of ```x``` and ```y```. Instead of that for getting coordinates (```x```, ```y```) changes, we must count projection of speed on the angle. For ```x``` it's ```speed * Math.cos(angle)``` and for y, as you can guess, ```speed * Math.sin(speed)```.

As you can notice we keep snake's direction in degrees, but for counting direction, we must convert them into radians:

```js:title=src/index.js
const degToRad = (angle) => ((angle * Math.PI) / 180)
```

After that, we'll get:

```js:title=src/index.js
running() {
  const radian = degToRad(this.angle)        // highlight-line
  this.x += Snake.SPEED * Math.cos(radian)   // highlight-line
  this.y += Snake.SPEED * Math.sin(radian)   // highlight-line

  this.draw()
}
```

After fixing, we'll get:

Letâ€™s check our control. Did you also get an error? Actually, itâ€™s the same problem with losing context for ```directionControl``` as we had for running inside ```setInterval```. Letâ€™s bind our snake to ```directionControl```.

After fixing, weâ€™ll get:

```js:title=src/index.js
const startGame = (game) => {
  const { snake } = game
  
  game.snakeInterval = setInterval(snake.running.bind(snake), 30)
 
  addEventListener('keydown', snake.directionControl.bind(snake)) // highlight-line
}
```

Let's test snake's controlling:
